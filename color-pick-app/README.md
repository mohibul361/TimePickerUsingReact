# Color Picker App

This project is a simple and interactive **Color Picker** built using React.js. It allows users to select and view colors dynamically, displaying the chosen color in real time. This project demonstrates how React's state management can be utilized for interactivity and how basic styling can enhance the UI.

## Features

- **Dynamic color selection**: Users can select a color from a color input field, and the selected color is applied to a display box in real-time.
- **User-friendly interface**: The app provides a clear and intuitive interface, showing the selected color in a large box along with the hex code.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used here to manage the state of the selected color and to render the components dynamically as the color changes.
- **HTML5**: Used to structure the application.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and layout. It provides responsiveness and a smooth visual design.
  
### React Concepts:
- **useState Hook**: The `useState` hook is used to store the currently selected color. The state updates whenever the user selects a new color from the input.
- **JSX**: JSX is used to render the HTML structure inside the React components.
